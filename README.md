# Facial Expression Recognition using Keras

Build and trained a CNN in Keras to recognize facial expressions. The data consisted of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective was to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of the seven categories and serve the trained model predictions to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
